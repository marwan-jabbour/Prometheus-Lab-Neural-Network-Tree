Built With: 

Java
Neuroph
JUnit
Panel

Getting Started:

1. Open Eclipse IDE
2. Click ‘open project from file system’
3. On the left window (package explorer) find the project Marwan_Jabbour_Prometheus
4. Right click on it, select ‘build path’, and then select ‘add external archives’
5. Find the lib folder included with the project, and open it
6. Select all the jar files inside it and press ok
7. You may also be required to add JUnit to class path (Eclipse handles this automatically)


Structure:

NeuralNetworksV1.Level1 —> contains all first-level neural networks from first version
NeuralNetworksV1.Level2 —> contains all higher level neural networks from first version
NeuralNetworksV2 -> contains all modified neural networks from second version

Simulations.DFS_Simulation -> contains simulation for the DFS neural network structure (version 3)
Simulations.NeuralNetworksV1.Level1 —> contains all first-level neural network simulations from first version
Simulations.NeuralNetworksV1.Level2 —> contains all higher-level neural network simulations from first version

test.NeuralNetworksV1.Level1 —> contains all first-level neural network test cases from first version
test.NeuralNetworksV1.Level2 —> contains all higher level neural network test cases from first version
test.NeuralNetworksV2—> contains all neural network test cases from second version


Usage:

Run the simulations in NeuralNetworksV1.Level1, NeuralNetworksV1.Level2, and Simulations.DFS_Simulation
Run test cases 
To test methods, use main.java file
